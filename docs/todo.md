- don't output all extensions. Only required (via settings) ones
- some way to detect installed vulkan version and automatically generate for it?
	- should be doable with meson (python vulkan module; get version; download spec; parse it)
	- Would probably require some spec version testing for codegen (fix issues with ALL spec version...)
- queueFamilyExternalKhr (i.e. constants of extensions) -> ...KHR
- rework/update error handling
	- don't use vpp_call by default?
	- give caller chance to handle error (without exception!)
